// Directory walker — runs Tree-sitter extractors over every supported file
// in a tree and pumps results into a GraphWriter.
//
// WHOLE-TREE IS NOT INCREMENTAL (bead MetaCoding-9jt). `indexDirectory` walks
// and extracts EVERY file, every time. It used to skip files whose content hash
// matched the stored ast_hash, and that skip was a correctness defect, not an
// optimization: cross-file edge candidates are resolved at the end of the walk
// against a SymbolResolver populated BY the walk, so a skipped file is absent
// from the resolver and every candidate pointing at it is dropped — silently,
// permanently, and while every freshness check still passes. Meanwhile the
// changed file's `deleteFileData` had already DETACH DELETEd edges owned by
// those very files. Measured: fresh 14 edges, incremental 12, both HEALTHY.
//
// The skip was also never where the time went. Parse + extract of this repo's
// 92 files is 269ms; the write path was 76s. See src/store/build.ts.
//
// `indexFile` / `removeFile` (watch mode) still write per-file into a live
// Store and still carry the defect above — deliberately, per
// docs/design/graph-as-cache.md, which names watch as a mutable scratch entry.
//
// Multi-repo: callers pass `repo` (defaults to the basename of the
// indexed root). Symbol ids include repo so cross-repo names don't clash.
//
// Multi-language dispatch: `.ts` / `.tsx` -> TypeScript extractor;
// `.py` -> Python extractor; `.php` -> PHP extractor.

   * `layer2Key|toolchainDigest|loadedArtifacts` across src/ and scripts/ and

   * So the whole-tree build now STATES the digest of the toolchain that
   * produced its facts, taken from the process registry — the same default
   * binding F3.1b holds. 0bm's own description is what this serves: "the cache
   * model requires a reader to RECOMPUTE a key from the artifact's own recorded
   * inputs".
   *
   * AND IT IS RECORDED, which for one release it was not (bead
   * MetaCoding-1j5). This field's whole consumer chain ended at a
   * `console.log` in src/cli/main.ts while this comment already called it
   * "recorded", so nothing that later opened the store could recover which
   * grammar produced its facts — a claim in a comment the code did not
   * implement. `runIndexSession` now writes it into the health record beside
   * `index_identities`, the persisted channel that already carries the SCIP
   * lane's input identities and is already read back from the store
   * (src/ingest/toolchain-recorded.test.ts).
   *
   * NOT YET the sealed keyed entry. `layer2Key` still has no production caller
   * because there is no manifest to put a key in (bead MetaCoding-ev9, named in
   * src/store/build.ts:33). The FOLD executes here; the KEY's other six inputs
   * do not exist, and inventing placeholders for them would fold constants into
