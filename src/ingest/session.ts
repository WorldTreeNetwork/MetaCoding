// The INDEX SESSION — root 2 of docs/design/index-fitness.md.
//
// THE SEAM, AND WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT IN THE CLI
// ==============================================
// The previous gate lived in `cmdIndex`, so `metacoding watch` — which ingests
// through the same primitives — had no gate at all, and any future caller would
// have to remember to add one. "Add a call in cmdWatch" fixes one caller and
// leaves the property depending on every future caller's memory. A guard is a
// patch the next reader walks around.
//
// So this module sits ABOVE extractor/scip and BELOW cli, and it is the ONLY
// exported ingest entry point in the tree:
//
//   * `indexDirectory`, `loadScip` and `runScip` are no longer re-exported from
//     `src/extractor` / `src/scip`; this file imports them from their private
//     modules, and they require an IngestTicket only a session can mint.
//     NOT A CONSTRUCTION — see MetaCoding-qv0: `Store.upsertSymbol` and
//     `Store.addEdge` are public on the exported `src/store` barrel, take no
//     ticket and call no gate, so a module can still grow a sealed-looking
//     slice while its record reads the old numbers (measured: 12 -> 28 symbols
//     under a record reporting fitness 12). The ticket guards the layer above
//     the writes. Superseded by docs/design/graph-as-cache.md.
//   * every ingest therefore opens a session, which writes a RUNNING record on
//     entry and finalizes a verdict on exit.
//
// The CLI's remaining job is one line: map the persisted verdict to an exit
// code. THE EXIT CODE IS A VIEW OF THE FACT, NOT THE FACT.
//
// A process that DIES never reaches finalize, so the record says RUNNING
// forever and every reader sees it. MetaCoding-ae5 is closed BY CONSTRUCTION,
// not by detection. That is also why an unexpected throw out of a lane is NOT
// converted into a finalized REFUSED here: a session that did not complete has
// not established anything, and saying so is the honest record.
//
// Not the store's WRITE path: a write path that refuses partial writes cannot
// express deliberate partial indexing and would fight the incremental
// primitives. Fitness is a judgement about a COMPLETED SESSION.
